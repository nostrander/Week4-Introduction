      I graduated from Cleveland State University in 1997 with a Bachelor's Degree
      in Computer Science. Currently, I do not have a Master's but that is on the 
      agenda for the future. Right now, I am working on refreshing my skills by getting 
      some post-degree certificates and getting myself back into the habit of doing coursework.

    <p>
      For the past 20+ years, I have worked in the IT department for a railroad
      track manufacturer <a href="http://www.clevelandtrack.com">(Cleveland Track Material)</a> in Cleveland, OH.  We currently have about 10 sites in 
      North and South America.
